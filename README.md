Bestaro is a library for collecting and accessing the data about lost&found pets
(especially dogs and cats) from various sources.

The goal is to be able to search efficiently and visualize them on a map to make it easier
to reach the original site where the advertisement was posted.


The main part of the application is **Core**, where the data is processed and stored.

It also contains a number of **Collectors** which are used to obtain the data
using the different means, for example an official API or crawling.
